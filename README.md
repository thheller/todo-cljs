# todo-cljs

TodoMVC implemented using ClojureScript + shadow cljs.

I was curious how it would compare to the other implementations. Could be a lot cleaner with some macros but I wanted to rewrite some parts of shadow for a while but just haven't found the "best" way yet. Some things just aren't pretty when it comes to the DOM side of things.

Anyways I obviously like the result over any other implementation since CLJS is so pretty.

Doesn't do everything yet, kinda got bored.
